        Dummy text: When you are almost about to start giving interviews,
        it is timed to prepare in a setting that mimics an actual interview.
        There are 3 things that you need to do for the same: Timed tests:
        You will get 30-45 minutes for a question during the interview. It
        is better to practice a good number of questions through timed tests
        to get used to solving problems fast. Code on whiteboard/paper: During
        onsite interviews, in most cases, you won't get access to a computer.
        You will have to write code on a whiteboard or a paper. Coding on it
        is very different from coding on an IDE. Practice on either of the two
        for a couple of days. Peer-to-peer mock interviews: Mock interviews
        can help you find and fix all the common mistakes before going for an
        actual interview, You can give peer-to-peer mock interviews on Pramp or
        InterviewBit or you can find a helpful friend.

      <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
      <p>
        Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
        typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
        nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
        non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
        recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution
        of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from
        making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the
        typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout
        or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
        less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
        patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
        the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous
        when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout
        impression of the final publication is not compromised.

      <h2>
        Incomprehensibility or readability? <small>That is the question.</small>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to
        have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a
        pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
        It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is
        also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European
        languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the
        relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not
        attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
        layout.
