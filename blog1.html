          Why switch to <span class="heading-inverted">SDE?</span> (Dummy blog)
        </h1>
      </header>
      <small>December, 2020</small>
      <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
      <p>
        While there is nothing wrong with working as a non-software developer,
        many want to switch to SDE roles generally for the following reasons:
        <ul>Extremely better pay</ul>
        <ul>Better work</ul>
        <ul>More ownership of the product</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take the example of the difference in salary for non-developer 
        roles vs software developer roles. Freshers in non-developer roles are 
        mostly paid 3-5L per year whereas SDEs at product-based companies easily 
        earn double of that. The big tech product-based companies and top startups 
        pay 4-5 times of that. It is obvious for most engineers to look up to joining
        as a software developer at a product-based company.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it is not easy to get there. It is not very difficult as well. It requires
        a different kind of preparation and a lot of hard work. The right amount of 
        hard work in the right direction can make it easy to achieve that if done 
        consistently.
      </p>
      <h1>Interview Stages for SDE-1 roles at product-based companies</h1>
      <h2>Resume Shortlisting</h2>
      <p>
        Most job openings receive 100s to 1000s of applications. It is not possible for
        a company to interview everyone who applies. To reduce the number of interviews, 
        Recruiters and Hiring Managers shortlist only those resumes which stand out 
        or match the most to the job roles.
      </p>
      <h2>Exploratory Call</h2>
      <p>
        This stage generally involves talking to a recruiter regarding past experience 
        and current expectations.If you have done good development work either on your
        job or through self-projects and have done sufficient research about the company
        and the roles before the call, this round should be pretty easy to clear.
      </p>
      <h2>Machine Coding Round/LLD/Take-Home Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        Companies like Uber, Flipkart, Swiggy, Udaan, etc have started hiring through
        the machine coding round as the first round. This round checks your coding and
        low-level design skills. It requires you to design and code a solution to a
        generic problem using best coding practices especially object-oriented programming.
        Most candidates get eliminated in this round.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem-Solving, Data Structures and Algorithms Round/Online Coding Round</h2>
      <p>
        Most product-based companies hire primarily through a data structure and algorithm
        interview. The basic idea of this interview is to test your problem-solving skills
        through your ability to figure out the right data structures and algorithms to solve
        logical problems. It is highly unlikely to get into a product-based company without
        being decent at DSA.
      </p>
      <h2>Hiring Manager/Bar Raiser/HR/Behavioral Round</h2>
      <p>
        This is usually the final round in most cases. You are judged on a mix of technical
        and non-technical competencies. Good projects and articulating your experience the
        right way may help you clear this round easily. Make sure to do sufficient research
        about the role before this round. Apart from the in-depth discussion on your projects,
        you might be asked puzzles, basic DSA questions, SQL queries, basic OOP, and other
        theoretical concepts
      </p>
      <h2>Learn to Code + Practice online coding</h2>
      <p>
        Learn to code with a strong focus on foundations. Suggested Languages: C++ or Java.
        You should aim to get so comfortable in coding that if youâ€™re told the high-level
        solution, you should be able to code it without much thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online coding is very different from how we are generally used to code in college
        classes or on the job. Practice a few basic questions on an online coding platform
        to build comfort.
      </p>
      <h2>Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
      <p>
        OOP is a very important programming paradigm that is generally used in almost all
        product-based companies. It is also tested in the machine coding and low-level
        design rounds. Having a good understanding of OOP concepts and some hands-on
        practice can help you get prepared.
      </p>
      <p>Till then, Happy Coding!</p>
